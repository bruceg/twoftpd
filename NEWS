-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.92

- Removed the code to handle anonymous logins from the authentication
  front end, in favour of recommending running a seperate anonymous
  server.

- Proper telnet escape translation is now done on output.

- Added some compatibility fixes, especially for glob.

NOTE: there will be no more features added, except for critical omissions,
before the 1.0 release, just bug fixes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.91

- Fixed a bug in socket handling that caused timeouts to be set too low.

- Fixed some minor bugs in command-line and environment handling.

  errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.9

- Fixed bug in EOF handling when storing files.

- IP addresses in PORT commands that do not match the remote IP address
  are now rejected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8

- Use glob library to handle wildcard handling.  This means twoftpd can
  now handle listing patterns like "test*/*".

- Dropped use of sendfile on Linux, since it's incompatible with
  handling timeouts on sending or receiving data.
