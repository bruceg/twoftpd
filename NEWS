-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.07

- Fixed a bug in handling listing unreadable directory entries that
  would cause listings to be prematurely terminated immediately before
  such an entry.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.06

- Fixed a one-off bug in doing pattern listings that caused all the
  resulting filenames to be prefixed with a '/'.

- Fixed some portability problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.05

- Rewrote all file handling operations to enable "emulated" chroot
  behavior.  There are now three modes of operation:
  1. Normal:  CWD appears as $HOME at login.
  2. Hard chroot:  CWD appears as / at login, and is enforced with a chroot.
  3. Emulated chroot:  CWD appears as / at login, with no chroot.
  In all of the cases, there is no chdir done after the server starts.
  This change was done to permit symlinks outside of $HOME.

- Improved the run files and the conf tools to run envdir on each
  connection rather than before tcpserver starts.  This allows the
  configuration variables to be modified without restarting the service.

- Added configuration for logging of responses, and made logging of
  requests optional.  You must now set $LOGREQUESTS if you want to log
  requests and $LOGRESPONSES if you want to log responses.

Changes in version 1.02

- Fixed a couple of bugs in twoftpd-anon-conf.

- Dotfiles should be skipped when listing directories.

- Made the numeric values of some success responses fall in line with
  the specifics of the FTP RFC.  This should hopefully fix many of the
  client failures.

- Added logging code to log requests and responses.

- The backend modules (twoftpd-anon and twoftpd-xfer) will optionally
  print out a banner on startup, and a message file on entering a
  directory.  As well, twoftpd-auth will optionally print out a banner
  before login.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.01

- Fixed a critical bug in parsing and printing IPs.

- Fixed a bug in handling listing single items.

- Fixed a minor usage documentation bug in the conf programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00

- Added twoftpd-conf and twoftpd-anon-conf programs.

- Minor internal socket and directory handling changes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.92

- Removed the code to handle anonymous logins from the authentication
  front end, in favour of recommending running a seperate anonymous
  server.

- Proper telnet escape translation is now done on output.

- Added some compatibility fixes, especially for glob.

NOTE: there will be no more features added, except for critical omissions,
before the 1.0 release, just bug fixes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.91

- Fixed a bug in socket handling that caused timeouts to be set too low.

- Fixed some minor bugs in command-line and environment handling.

- Fixed an iobuf bug that caused opened output files to not be closed on
  errors.

- Added support for the REST command, to speed up resumed transfers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.9

- Fixed bug in EOF handling when storing files.

- IP addresses in PORT commands that do not match the remote IP address
  are now rejected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8

- Use glob library to handle wildcard handling.  This means twoftpd can
  now handle listing patterns like "test*/*".

- Apply timeouts on all socket handling routines.

- Dropped use of sendfile on Linux, since it's incompatible with
  handling timeouts on sending or receiving data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7

- Fixed a bug that caused PORT-style connections to fail.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.6

- Can now handle LIST and NLST on non-directories.

- Should now automatically use sendfile on Linux systems.

- Can now handle ASCII mode file transfers.

- Can now handle RNFR/RNTO file renaming commands.

- Can now handle newlines (octal 012) in paths.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.5

- TwoFTPd now uses CVM (http://em.ca/~bruceg/cvm/) for authentication.

- twoftpd-auth needs to have the anonymous configuration parameters set
  by environment variables instead of reading them through getpwnam.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.4

- Now handles timout when making PORT connections.

- Simplified the directory listing format.

- Configured and packaged with SPAC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.3

- Now supports anonymous logins with reduced priviledges.

- Now handles both PASV and PORT mode connections.

- Now handles STOR and APPE file upload commands.

- Handles additional verbs: MDTM, RMD, MKD, DELE.

- Times out on PASV connections and receiving commands, as specified
  by $TIMEOUT (defaults to 900 seconds).

- If $CHROOT is set, twoftpd-xfer will chroot on entry.
