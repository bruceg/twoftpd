twoftpd
Simple secure efficient FTP server

This is twoftpd, a new FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
efficient.  None of the commands can cause execution of other programs,
and the normal model of execution does a chroot to the logged in user's
directory immediately after authentication.

The name "twoftpd" comes from the fact that there are two parts to the
server -- an authenticating front end, which contains no file or data
transfer code, and one of two back ends, which contain all the data
transfer code.

Programs:

The package is broken down into two main programs: twoftpd-auth is a
front-end that only accepts USER and PASS (and a few other "built-in")
commands.  Once a user is authenticated, it exec's twoftpd-xfer (or
twoftpd-anon), which does a chdir/chroot/setgid/setuid combination to
lock down all priviledges.  twoftpd-anon differs from twoftpd-xfer by
not having any commands available that can make filesystem changes.

Usage:

tcpserver -DHRv 0 21 /usr/local/bin/twoftpd-auth cvm-unix \
	/usr/local/bin/twoftpd-xfer -- /usr/local/bin/twoftpd-anon
