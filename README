This is twoftpd, a new FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
efficient.

The name "twoftpd" comes from the fact that there are two parts to the
server.

This package is currently in a limited but useful stage.  It can do
directory listings and store and retrieve files using either PASV or
PORT mode.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.

Programs:

The package is broken down into two main programs: twoftpd-auth is a
front-end that only accepts USER and PASS (and a few other "built-in")
commands.  Once a user is authenticated, it exec's twoftpd-xfer (or
twoftpd-anon), which does a chdir/chroot/setgid/setuid combination to
lock down all priviledges.  twoftpd-anon differs from twoftpd-xfer by
not having any commands available that can make filesystem changes.

Usage:

tcpserver -v 0 21 /usr/local/bin/twoftpd-auth \
	/usr/local/bin/twoftpd-xfer -- /usr/local/bin/twoftpd-anon

Known bugs:

- Doing LIST/NLST on non-directories will fail.

- The ASCII/binary mode flag is ignored.

- Pathnames containing LFs will not be handled properly (on input or
  output).

- See the TODO file for unimplemented features.
