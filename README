twoftpd
Simple secure efficient FTP server

This is twoftpd, a new FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
efficient.

This package is currently in a proof-of-implementation stage.  I can
retrieve directories and files with NcFTP PASV mode (which means it
should work for web browsers as well), but that's about it.

The name "twoftpd" comes from the fact that there are two parts to the
server.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.

Programs:

The package is broken down into two main programs: twoftpd-auth is a
front-end that only accepts USER and PASS (and a few other "built-in")
commands.  Once a user is authenticated, it exec's twoftpd-xfer, which
does a chdir/chroot/setgid/setuid combination to lock down all
priviledges.

Usage:

tcpserver -v 0 21 /usr/local/bin/twoftpd-auth
