.SH SYNOPSIS
.B twoftpd-xfer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B twoftpd-xfer
reads FTP request from the network and executes file
transfers based on those requests.
Before doing anything,
.B twoftpd-xfer
changes directory to the authenticated user's home directory, changes
the root directory to that directory, and drops all root priviledges.

provided by the chroot, but allows for things like symlinks outside of
the home directory.
